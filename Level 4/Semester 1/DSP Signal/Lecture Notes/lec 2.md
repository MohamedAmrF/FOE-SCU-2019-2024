> Sampling -> Quantization -> encoding

### Sampling: 
- Follow ***Nyquitst rate***, ***sampling theroem*** 
- 8000 sample per second (64 kbit/second)

### Digital signal Representation
- we'll work on a number of samples


### Discrete Time systems:  
1) Memory less systems:  
     - Doesn't depend on previous inputs.


2) Linear and non linear sytems: 
    - input: a  ---> output: x
    - const * a + cons2* b = const *x + const2 * y
    - a + b = x + y


3) Time variant and time invariant systems
    - ***Time Variant*** :  replace n with 2n and check if the output is shifted by the same amount.
